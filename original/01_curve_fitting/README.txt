This performs curve fitting on individual grid cells.

Other data files are needed in this directory for the code to run. They are:

etopo60.cdf : Bathymetry from Ferret
mean_directional_acfs.R : directional decorrelation lengths calculated for each grid cell
mean_temporal_acf.csv : The mean temporal ACF calculated for the entire ocean
pco2_spatial_variation.R : Cell to cell variations in pCO2 measurements
